# GIT

Hey, this is my first tuto about Git !  
Letâ€™s go discover Git and its environment.  
To begin not forget to install Git on your computer, on Windows I advise to choose **GitBash** software.  
For Linux no problem, Git is already installed.  
Everything you do in this tuto will be done in command line.  
If you are prepared, you can start !  

For the Windows guys : 
- Right click on your desktop
- Choose **Git Bash Here**

For the Linux player : 
- Just open a command line

Now it's the same work if you are pro Windows or a Linux priest

Create a simple folder with 
```vim
mkdir my_git_project
```

Let's go in this great folder 
```vim
cd my_git_project
```

Git use a repository system, the simplest is to create one repository by project  
Here is the initialize git command : 
```vim
git init 
```

Nice you have write your first git command ! :tada:
